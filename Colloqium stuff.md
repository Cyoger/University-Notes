title = Crafting the next frontier: smart, secure and self-healing cyber-physical systems for a hyperconnected world

Agenda 
## Wing Lab big picture
he has multiple research partners with big tech industry companies 
eg. bell canada, telus, IBM, ericsson, juniper networks, amazon, nokia, hp, google, hexagon, instacart, servicenow, comcor, tillsonburg hydro, city of london 

building blocks of his research
applied AI is heavily used
novel, secure, & cost effective technology development 
cyber security

WING Labs Networks(cisco, juniper, bell canada, and hp)

Bamboo innovations inc. 
bambooinnovations.ca (see later for report :pain: ) (enterpreneur big man)

pyramid
affordability -> emerging technologies (phones being as powerful as laptops due to microprocessor developments) -> AI & Data science (gpt) , computing power: moore;s law -> digital connectivity: communication networks 5G & beyond 

(hyperconnected smart world)







##connected vehicles and autonomous drones research
autonomous drones smart city connected autonomous vehicles

Long distance drone delivery 
amazon started their drone delivery, california -> texas - limited trial

amazon MK27-2 MODEL DROP packages from about 12 feet in the air 
weighing heavy 

use a cell based and region based approach, have points and resources for drones, to deliver stuff to coordinate with an algorithmic based approach 
job scheduling optimization to minimize the delivery time 
collaboration 
  
his prototype developed out of his london lab in Western University 

proof of concept to get a drone to waterloo?
oh exchange each package at a centre
for example London -> Waterloo -> Toronto 
these drones that travel, need to go back to home centre
use heuristic algos 

Micro-drone exploration in GPS-denied environment
paths and nodes 
(hybrid space exploration algorithm)


Autonomous drones for carbon emission management 




cyber security and network resiliency research
RTK assisted smart parking systems

cost effective smart parking solution in the market

challenges 
location accuracy in parking spots - mapping of GPS data to parking spots
real time processing 

smart parking app demo 

yellow booked
green avbailable
red car exits there? 

project blindspot: alerts pedestrian and driver of potential collision 
	probability based model to take decisions on collision???

Network/ICT systems Failure forecast - when to expect the next failure? 

smart phone loss prevention 70 million smart phones are lost each year and only 5% is recovered 

prototype is novel intelligent cost-effective and prevents the loss of smart phones 
market

novel 5g enabled zero-client computing 

ultra-thin green computing platform thanks to 5G MEC. 
5G MEC based reliable, convenient, light-weight, environment friendly, and cost efficient novel ultra-think computing model
